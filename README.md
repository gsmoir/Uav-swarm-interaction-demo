Uav-swarm-interaction-demo
==========================

This project is a demo project, that helped me selected for a robotics project on 'Uav swarm interaction'. My assignment was to interact two uav's to make them work simultaneously to pick up an object from a remote place and bring it back,which are controlled remotely.
The project is developed in Java, using Netbeans.
